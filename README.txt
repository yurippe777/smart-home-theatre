# smart-home-theatre - senior design project
Project completed back in May, 2022.

UPDATE: 1/19/2023
The code will have the camera scan for TV using computer vision in Python, then when it finds one it will begin to scan for RGB values on the edge of the screen. Once these values are found they a text file will be created which constantly gets updated each frame. Program will work on Raspberry Pi 4, and fill fail if no TV is detected in frame. Do not move the camera after the initialization is complete. Variables can be edited to account for different TV sizes, and thus more or less RGB signals being needed. 
Project is complete - no further updates will be made.
